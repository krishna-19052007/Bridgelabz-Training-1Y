/*Create a program to print the greatest factor of a number beside itself using a loop.
Hint =>
a. Get an integer input and assign it to the number variable. As well as define a
greatestFactor variable and assign it to 1
b. Create a for loop that runs from last but one till 1 as in i = number - 1 to i = 1.
c. Inside the loop, check if the number is perfectly divisible by i then assign i to
greatestFactor variable and break the loop.
d. Display the greatestFactor variable outside the loop */
